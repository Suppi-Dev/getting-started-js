- Hello, world! (1.Lesson navigation
2.The “script” tag
3.Modern markup
4.External scripts)
browser-specific commands (like alert)
how we attach a script to a webpage- For server-side environments (like Node.js),
you can execute the script with a command like "node my.js"
JavaScript programs can be inserted almost anywhere into an HTML document using the <script> tag 
 

- Code structure
<html>

<body>

  <p>Before the script...</p>

  <script>
    alert( 'Hello, world!' );
  </script>

  <p>...After the script.</p>

</body>
</html>
{****run the example by clicking the “Play” button in the right-top corner of the box above.

The <script> tag contains JavaScript code which is automatically executed when the browser processes the tag****}
  MODERN MARKUP
1.  The type attribute: <script type=…>               }=NOT REQURIED
2.  The language attribute: <script language=…>
<script type="text/javascript"><!--
    ...
//--></script>
EXTERNAL  SCRIPTS
  
A single <script> tag can’t have both the src attribute and code inside
<script src="file.js">
  alert(1); // the content is ignored, because src is set
</script>

The example above can be split into two scripts to work:

<script src="file.js"></script>
<script>
  alert(1);
</script>
*We can use a <script> tag to add JavaScript code to a page.
The type and language attributes are not required.
A script in an external file can be inserted with <script src="path/to/script.js"></script>*

Code structure
The first thing we’ll study is the building blocks of code.

1)Statements----Statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions,, alert('Hello, world!'), which shows the message “Hello, world!”.Statements can be separated with a semicolon.EXAMPLE  here we split “Hello World” into two alerts:alert('Hello'); alert('World');Usually, statements are written on separate lines to make the code more readable
alert('Hello');
alert('World');

2)Semicolons----A semicolon may be omitted in most cases when a line break exists.alert('Hello'),alert('World'),,Here, JavaScript interprets the line break as an “implicit” semicolon. This is called an automatic semicolon insertion.In most cases, a newline implies a semicolon. But “in most cases” does not mean “always”!-example:alert(3 + 
1
+ 2);      ****The code outputs 6 because JavaScript does not insert semicolons here. It is intuitively obvious that if the line ends with a plus "+", then it is an “incomplete expression”, so a semicolon there would be incorrect****

3)Comments----Comments can be put into any place of a script. They don’t affect its execution because the engine simply ignores them.
one-line comments start with two forward slash characters //.,,,,The rest of the line is a comment. It may occupy a full line of its own or follow a statement.
Like here:
// This comment occupies a line of its own
alert('Hello');
alert('World'); // This comment follows the statement
(Multiline comments start with a forward slash and an asterisk /* and end with an asterisk and a forward slash */)
Like this:
[/* An example with two messages.
This is a multiline comment.
*/
alert('Hello');
alert('World');]
