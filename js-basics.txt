- Hello, world! (1.Lesson navigation
2.The ‚Äúscript‚Äù tag
3.Modern markup
4.External scripts)
browser-specific commands (like alert)
how we attach a script to a webpage- For server-side environments (like Node.js),
you can execute the script with a command like "node my.js"
JavaScript programs can be inserted almost anywhere into an HTML document using the <script> tag 
 

- Code structure
<html>

<body>

  <p>Before the script...</p>

  <script>
    alert( 'Hello, world!' );
  </script>

  <p>...After the script.</p>

</body>
</html>
{****run the example by clicking the ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù button in the right-top corner of the box above.

The <script> tag contains JavaScript code which is automatically executed when the browser processes the tag****}
  MODERN MARKUP
1.  The type attribute: <script type=‚Ä¶>               }=NOT REQURIED
2.  The language attribute: <script language=‚Ä¶>
<script type="text/javascript"><!--
    ...
//--></script>
EXTERNAL  SCRIPTS
  
A single <script> tag can‚Äôt have both the src attribute and code inside
<script src="file.js">
  alert(1); // the content is ignored, because src is set
</script>

The example above can be split into two scripts to work:

<script src="file.js"></script>
<script>
  alert(1);
</script>
*We can use a <script> tag to add JavaScript code to a page.
The type and language attributes are not required.
A script in an external file can be inserted with <script src="path/to/script.js"></script>*

B))))
Code structure
The first thing we‚Äôll study is the building blocks of code.

1)Statements----Statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions,, alert('Hello, world!'), which shows the message ‚ÄúHello, world!‚Äù.Statements can be separated with a semicolon.EXAMPLE  here we split ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù into two alerts:alert('Hello'); alert('World');Usually, statements are written on separate lines to make the code more readable
alert('Hello');
alert('World');

2)Semicolons----A semicolon may be omitted in most cases when a line break exists.alert('Hello'),alert('World'),,Here, JavaScript interprets the line break as an ‚Äúimplicit‚Äù semicolon. This is called an automatic semicolon insertion.In most cases, a newline implies a semicolon. But ‚Äúin most cases‚Äù does not mean ‚Äúalways‚Äù!-example:alert(3 + 
1
+ 2);      ****The code outputs 6 because JavaScript does not insert semicolons here. It is intuitively obvious that if the line ends with a plus "+", then it is an ‚Äúincomplete expression‚Äù, so a semicolon there would be incorrect****

3)Comments----Comments can be put into any place of a script. They don‚Äôt affect its execution because the engine simply ignores them.
one-line comments start with two forward slash characters //.,,,,The rest of the line is a comment. It may occupy a full line of its own or follow a statement.
Like here:
// This comment occupies a line of its own
alert('Hello');
alert('World'); // This comment follows the statement
(Multiline comments start with a forward slash and an asterisk /* and end with an asterisk and a forward slash */)
Like this:
[/* An example with two messages.
This is a multiline comment.
*/
alert('Hello');
alert('World');]
Multiline comments start with a forward slash and an asterisk /* and end with an asterisk and a forward slash */.

Like this:

/* An example with two messages.
This is a multiline comment.
*/
alert('Hello');
alert('World');
The content of comments is ignored, so if we put code inside /* ‚Ä¶ */, it won‚Äôt execute.

Sometimes it can be handy to temporarily disable a part of code:

/* Commenting out the code
alert('Hello');
*/
alert('World');
Use hotkeys!
In most editors, a line of code can be commented out by pressing the Ctrl+/ hotkey for a single-line comment and something like Ctrl+Shift+/ ‚Äì for multiline comments (select a piece of code and press the hotkey). For Mac, try Cmd instead of Ctrl and Option instead of Shift.

Nested comments are not supported!
There may not be /*...*/ inside another /*...*/.

Multiline comments start with a forward slash and an asterisk /* and end with an asterisk and a forward slash */.

Like this:

/* An example with two messages.
This is a multiline comment.
*/
alert('Hello');
alert('World');
The content of comments is ignored, so if we put code inside /* ‚Ä¶ */, it won‚Äôt execute.

Sometimes it can be handy to temporarily disable a part of code:

/* Commenting out the code
alert('Hello');
*/
alert('World');

Nested comments are not supported!
There may not be /*...*/ inside another /*...*/.

Such code will die with an error:

/*
  /* nested comment ?!? */
*/
alert( 'World' );
Please, don‚Äôt hesitate to comment your code.

C))))The modern mode, "use strict"
For a long time, JavaScript evolved without compatibility issues. New features were added to the language while old functionality didn‚Äôt change.
The modern mode, "use strict"
For a long time, JavaScript evolved without compatibility issues. New features were added to the language while old functionality didn‚Äôt change.

That had the benefit of never breaking existing code. But the downside was that any mistake or an imperfect decision made by JavaScript‚Äôs creators got stuck in the language forever.

This was the case until 2009 when ECMAScript 5 (ES5) appeared. It added new features to the language and modified some of the existing ones. To keep the old code working, most such modifications are off by default. You need to explicitly enable them with a special directive: "use strict".

‚Äúuse strict‚Äù
The directive looks like a string: "use strict" or 'use strict'. When it is located at the top of a script, the whole script works the ‚Äúmodern‚Äù way.

For example:

"use strict";

// this code works the modern way
...
Browser console::::
When you use a developer console to run code, please note that it doesn‚Äôt use strict by default.

Sometimes, when use strict makes a difference, you‚Äôll get incorrect results.

So, how to actually use strict in the console?

First, you can try to press Shift+Enter to input multiple lines, and put use strict on top, like this:

'use strict'; <Shift+Enter for a newline>
//  ...your code
<Enter to run>
It works in most browsers, namely Firefox and Chrome.

(function() {
  'use strict';

  // ...your code here...
})()
Should we ‚Äúuse strict‚Äù?


A variable 
is a ‚Äúnamed storage‚Äù for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data.

To create a variable in JavaScript, use the let keyword.

let message
Now, we can put some data into it by using the assignment operator =:

let message;

message = 'Hello'; // store the string 'Hello' in the variable named message

let message;
message = 'Hello!';
alert(message); // shows the variable content
To be concise, we can combine the variable declaration and assignment into a single line:
let message = 'Hello!'; // define the variable and assign the value
alert(message); // Hello!
We can also declare multiple variables in one line:

let user = 'John', age = 25, message = 'Hello';

A real-life analogyü§ûüòÉ
We can easily grasp the concept of a ‚Äúvariable‚Äù if we imagine it as a ‚Äúbox‚Äù for data, with a uniquely-named sticker on it

We can also change it as many times as we want
let message;
message = 'Hello!';
message = 'World!'; // value changed

alert(message);
When the value is changed, the old data is removed from the variable:


*We can also declare two variables and copy data from one into the other.

let hello = 'Hello world!';
let message;
// copy 'Hello world' from hello into message
message = hello;

// now two variables hold the same dataThere are two limitations on variable names in JavaScript:

The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _.
The first character must not be a digit.
Examples of valid names:
let userName;
let test123;
alert(hello); // Hello world!
alert(message); // Hello world!

Constants
To declare a constant (unchanging) variable, use const instead of let:
const myBirthday = '18.04.1982';
Variables declared using const are called ‚Äúconstants‚Äù. They cannot be reassigned. An attempt to do so would cause an error:
const myBirthday = '18.04.1982';
myBirthday = '01.01.2001'; // error, can't reassign the constant!

Data types::::
A value in JavaScript is always of a certain type. For example, a string or a number.

There are eight basic data types in JavaScript. Here, we‚Äôll cover them in general and in the next chapters we‚Äôll talk about each of them in detail.
1)Number
2) BigInt
3) String
4) Boolean (logical type)
5) The ‚Äúnull‚Äù value
6) The ‚Äúundefined‚Äù value
7)objects and Symbols
8)The typeof operator

E))))Interaction: alert, prompt, confirm

alert
prompt
confirm
As we‚Äôll be using the browser as our demo environment, let‚Äôs see a couple of functions to interact with the user: alert, prompt and confirm.

alertü§û
This one we‚Äôve seen already. It shows a message and waits for the user to press ‚ÄúOK‚Äù.

For example:
alert("Hello");

prompt ü§û
The function prompt accepts two arguments:

result = prompt(title, [default]);
It shows a modal window with a text message, an input field for the visitor, and the buttons OK/Cancel.

 confirmü§û
The syntax:

result = confirm(question);
The function confirm shows a modal window with a question and two buttons: OK and Cancel.
The result is true if OK is pressed and false otherwise.
For example:
let isBoss = confirm("Are you the boss?");

alert( isBoss ); // true if OK is pressed

G))))Type Conversions
Most of the time, operators and functions automatically convert the values given to them to the right type.

For example, alert automatically converts any value to a string to show it. Mathematical operations convert values to numbers.
String Conversion
Numeric Conversion
Boolean Conversion

1)String conversion happens when we need the string form of a value.

For example, alert(value) does it to show the value.

We can also call the String(value) function to convert a value to a string:
let value = true;
alert(typeof value); // boolean
value = String(value); // now value is a string "true"
alert(typeof value); // string

2)Numeric conversion happens in mathematical functions and expressions automatically.

For example, when division / is applied to non-numbers:

alert( "6" / "2" ); // 3, strings are converted to numbers
We can use the Number(value) function to explicitly convert a value to a number
let str = "123";
alert(typeof str); // string
let num = Number(str); // becomes a number 123
alert(typeof num); // number

3)Numeric conversion happens in mathematical functions and expressions automatically.

For example, when division / is applied to non-numbers:

alert( "6" / "2" ); // 3, strings are converted to numbers
We can use the Number(value) function to explicitly convert a value to a number:

let str = "123";
alert(typeof str); // string
let num = Number(str); // becomes a number 123
alert(typeof num); // number
