- Hello, world! (1.Lesson navigation
2.The “script” tag
3.Modern markup
4.External scripts)
browser-specific commands (like alert)
how we attach a script to a webpage- For server-side environments (like Node.js),
you can execute the script with a command like "node my.js"
JavaScript programs can be inserted almost anywhere into an HTML document using the <script> tag 
 

- Code structure
<html>

<body>

  <p>Before the script...</p>

  <script>
    alert( 'Hello, world!' );
  </script>

  <p>...After the script.</p>

</body>
</html>
{****run the example by clicking the “Play” button in the right-top corner of the box above.

The <script> tag contains JavaScript code which is automatically executed when the browser processes the tag****}
  MODERN MARKUP
1.  The type attribute: <script type=…>               }=NOT REQURIED
2.  The language attribute: <script language=…>
<script type="text/javascript"><!--
    ...
//--></script>
EXTERNAL  SCRIPTS
  
A single <script> tag can’t have both the src attribute and code inside
<script src="file.js">
  alert(1); // the content is ignored, because src is set
</script>

The example above can be split into two scripts to work:

<script src="file.js"></script>
<script>
  alert(1);
</script>
*We can use a <script> tag to add JavaScript code to a page.
The type and language attributes are not required.
A script in an external file can be inserted with <script src="path/to/script.js"></script>*

B))))
Code structure
The first thing we’ll study is the building blocks of code.

1)Statements----Statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions,, alert('Hello, world!'), which shows the message “Hello, world!”.Statements can be separated with a semicolon.EXAMPLE  here we split “Hello World” into two alerts:alert('Hello'); alert('World');Usually, statements are written on separate lines to make the code more readable
alert('Hello');
alert('World');
2)Semicolons----A semicolon may be omitted in most cases when a line break exists.
3)Comments
